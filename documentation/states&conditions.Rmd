## Further Conditions

* Animosity (Animosität)
* Brazirakus heilige Wut (Brazirakus' holy rage)
* Eiskalte Einflüsterung
* Loss of Sikaryan (Sikaryan-Verlust)
* Theriak-Vorrat
* Trance (Trance)


## Approach

Most conditions can be handled with two mechanisms:

1. Modifier grid: 
   * List of the modifiers for all skills, attributes, combat actions.
   * Placeholders are allowed. 
   * These will be applied when a check is required.
1. Grid of consequences: 
   * List of modifiers for conditions (incl. "this" condition) 
   * Will be applied when the level of the condition is set.

This works for all conditions except demonic consumption, rapture, desire and arousal; further conditions are also excluded.

Also not counting effects on regeneration.
